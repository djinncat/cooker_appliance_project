# cooker_appliance_project
Hi! This code was written as part of an assignment for a hypothetical cooker appliance. Written and tested using MPlabX and simulated using PICSimLab for proof of function.
The appliance entailed several automated cooking programs and was designed to interface with various components such as weight, temperature and humidity sensors.
